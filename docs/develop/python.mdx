Welcome to the Resonate Python SDK guide!
This SDK makes it possible to write Distributed Async Await applications with Python.
This guide covers installation and features that the SDK offers.

➡️ [Resonate Python SDK API reference](https://resonatehq.github.io/resonate-sdk-py/)

## Installation

**How to install the Resonate Python SDK into your project.**

To install the Resonate Python SDK, you can use any of your favorite package managers.

**Rye**

```shell
rye add resonate-sdk
```

**Pip**

```shell
pip install resonate-sdk
```

Then initialize the SDK in your project, register your top-level function(s) and call `.run()`:

```python
from resonate.scheduler import Scheduler

# ...

resonate = Scheduler(durable_promise_storage=LocalPromiseStore())
resonate.register(your_func)
resonate.run(your_func)
```

## Promise storage modes

The Resonate Python SDK supports two storage modes: Local and Remote.

### Local storage

**How to use Local storage mode in the Resonate Python SDK.**

[Local storage mode](/concepts/durable-promise#local-storage) is ideal for starting out with Resonate.

```python
resonate = Scheduler(durable_promise_storage=LocalPromiseStore())
```

### Remote storage

**How to use Remote storage mode in the Resonate Python SDK.**

Remote storage ensures promises are stored in the Resonate Server.
To enable Remote storage, pass the Resonate Server's address when initializing Resonate:

```python
resonate = Scheduler(durable_promise_storage=RemotePromiseStore(url="http://localhost:8001"))
```

## Set a Retry Policy

**How to set a Retry Policy in the Resonate Python SDK.**

You can set a Retry Policy to control how a function should be retried if it fails.
A Retry Policy can be set at the function level or when the individual function is invoked.

There are several different [built in Retry Policies available](/concepts/failure-detection-and-recovery#retry-policies), and each one can be refined to your needs.

### Function registration

Here is an example of setting an Exponential Retry Policy when registering a function:

```python
from resonate.retry_policy import Exponential

// ...

resonate.register(your_func, retry_policy=Exponential())
```

### Function invocation

Here is an example of setting a Constant Retry Policy when invoking a function:

```python
from resonate.retry_policy import Constant

// ...

ctx.lfc(another_func, retry_policy=Constant())
```

## Dependency injection

**How to use Dependency injection in the Resonate Python SDK.**

You can inject dependencies into your Resonate instance and use them in functions that receive the Resonate Context.

```python
from resonate.scheduler import Scheduler
from resonate.storage import LocalPromiseStore

# ...

s = Scheduler(durable_promise_storage=LocalPromiseStore())
# ...
s._deps.set("dependency-a", dependency())
s._deps.set("dependency-b", "some-dependency")
```

Then you can access the dependencies in your functions:

```python
def your_func(ctx: Context):
# ...
dep = ctx.deps.get("dependency-a")
```
