This quickstart tutorial introduces you to the Resonate Python SDK.

## Part 1

In [Part 1](/get-started/python-quickstart/part-1), you develop your first _Distributed Async Await_ application with the Resonate SDK, a summarization service.
This part illustrates features such as transparent function retries and retry rate limits, simply through the integration of the Resonate SDK, without the need for any additional infrastructure.
