In Part 2 of the tutorial, you will connect your service to a Resonate Server to enable recovery from platform-level failures.
To simulate a platform-level failure, you will kill the HTTP server process in the middle of the execution of the `downloadAndSummarize()` function.

### Prerequisites

This part of the tutorial assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and that you have completed [Part 1](/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-1) and already have the service built.

## Install the Resonate Server

Follow the steps in the [Resonate Server install guide](/get-started/server-installation) to install and run the server on your machine.

By default, the Server runs on localhost port 8001.

After the server is running, you can update your service code.

## Update your code

There are three places where you need to update your code for this nex part of the tutorial.

First, in your `gateway.ts` file, update the `new Resonate()` call and provide it with the URL of the server, in this case `http://localhost:8001`.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-server-url-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/gateway.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/gateway.ts)
```ts
// Initialize a Resonate application.
const resonate = new Resonate({ url: "http://localhost:8001" });
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

Then, extend the top-level promise resolution timeout to a full minute.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-register-timeout-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/gateway.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/gateway.ts)
```ts
// Register a function as a Resonate function
resonate.register(
  "downloadAndSummarize", // function name
  downloadAndSummarize, // function pointer
  resonate.options({ timeout: 60000 }) // set a total execution timeout of 1 minute
);
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

You are increasing the top-level promise resolution timeout to a full minute so that you have time to kill the service and bring it back up again.

And finally, in your `app.ts` file add a 10 second sleep to the `downloadAndSummarize()` function between `download()` and `summarize()`.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-add-sleep-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/app.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-2/code/src/app.ts)
```ts
export async function downloadAndSummarize(ctx: Context, url: string) {
  console.log("Downloading and summarizing content from", url);

  // Download the content from the provided URL
  let content = await ctx.run(download, url);

  // Sleep for 10 seconds
  await ctx.sleep(10000);

  // Summarize the downloaded content
  let summary = await ctx.run(summarize, content);

  // Return the summary of the content
  return summary;
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

You are adding a 10 second sleep so that you have time between the `download()` step and the `summarize()` step so that you have time to kill the service before the `summarize()` step starts.

Now that you have your code updated, it is time to simulate a service outage.

## Simulate a crash

If you haven't already, restart your HTTP service with the updated code.

```shell
npm start
```

After your service is running with the updated code, send the `POST` request to your service.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://example.com"}'
```

Let it run it until you see that the log "download successful", then kill (Ctrl-c) the service.

:::note

Because you are using cURL from another terminal, you will receive "received"
In Part 1 of the tutorial, killing the HTTP service would have resulted in the loss of the state of the executions.
However, because the service was connected to the Resonate Server, when you bring the service back up, the execution sequence will continue where it left off.

:::

Start the service again.
Assuming that you stopped the service after the `download()` function ran, you should now see the `summarize()` function logs and the application complete its execution.

Next, you will inspect the promise in the Resonate Server to see that it resolved successfully.

## Inspect promises

You can inspect the promises stored in the Resonate Server via the Resonate CLI.

```bash
resonate promise get summarize-http://example.com
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Id:       summarize-http://example.com
State:    RESOLVED
Timeout:  9008909898871320

Idempotency Key (create):    summarize-http://example.com
Idempotency Key (complete):  summarize-http://example.com

Param:
  Headers:
  Data:
    {"func":"downloadAndSummarize","args":["http://example.com"]}

Value:
  Headers:
  Data:
    "This is a summary of the text"

Tags:
  resonate:invocation:  true
```

:::tip

Try out your app again with another url (to create a new promise with a different ID).
Then, kill the HTTP service halfway through execution.
Query for the promise in the Resonate Server and check out the status.

You should see that the promise is marked `PENDING`.

Bring your HTTP service back up and and then query for the promise again.

It should be marked `RESOLVED`.

:::

So, now you should have a good understanding of how to use the Resonate SDK and the Resonate Server to build a distributed async await applications!
