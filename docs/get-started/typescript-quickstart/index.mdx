This quickstart tutorial introduces you to the Resonate TypeScript SDK by building a mock summarization service using Resonate.
The first part of the tutorial showcases how Resonate provides Durable Execution for application-level failures using the SDK's local promise storage.

Durable Execution for application-level failures means that you get promise resolution timeouts, transparent function execution retries, and retry rate limits without adding an additional supervisor service.

You will create an HTTP service with a single route handler.
The handler will use `resonate.run()` to run the `downloadAndSummarize()` function.
Resonate will manage the execution of these functions, ensuring that the result of `download()` is passed as input to `summarize()`.

If any of the functions throw an error or reject a promise, Resonate will automatically retry the function execution.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Set up the project

Create a project folder.

```bash
mkdir resonate-quickstart && cd resonate-quickstart
```

Install the dev dependencies.

```bash
npm init -y && npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev
```

Install the app dependencies.

```bash
npm install @resonatehq/sdk express @types/express
```

Create a file named **app.ts** and copy and paste the minimal distributed async/await application below:

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-1-app-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-1/src/app.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-1/src/app.ts)
```ts
import { Context } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

// downloadAndSummarize is the top level function that awaits on the download and summarize functions.
export async function downloadAndSummarize(ctx: Context, url: string) {
  // Download the content from the provided URL
  console.log("Downloading and summarizing content from", url);
  let content = await ctx.run(download, url);

  // Summarize the downloaded content
  let summary = await ctx.run(summarize, content);

  // Return the summary of the content
  return summary;
}

// download simulates downloading a page from the internet.
// This function has a 50% chance of failing.
async function download(ctx: Context, url: string): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // 50% chance to fail
      if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        console.log("download failed");
        reject("download failed");
      } else {
        console.log("download successful");
        resolve("This is the text of the page");
      }
    }, 2500);
  });
}

// summarize simulates summarizing the downloaded content
// This function has a 50% chance of failing.
async function summarize(ctx: Context, text: string): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // 50% chance to fail
      if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        console.log("summarization failed");
        reject("summarization failed");
      } else {
        console.log("summarization successful");
        resolve("This is a summary of the text");
      }
    }, 2500);
  });
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

The code that makes up `app.ts` is a simple mock application that simulates downloading a page from the internet and then summarizing the content of that page.
It represents the "business logic" of the service.
You have your `downloadAndSummarize()` main function that orchestrates the steps of your application (`download()` then `summarize()`).

Both the `download()` and `summarize()` functions include a 2.5-second timeout to simulate the time required for downloading and summarizing content from a URL.
These functions are invoked using `ctx.run`, which wraps the function call in a promise, adds it to the call graph, and introduces durability.

In this example, `download()` and `summarize()` are mock functions designed to “fail” 50% of the time.
When they return a “rejected” promise, Resonate automatically retries them until they succeed.

Next, create a file named `gateway.ts` and paste in the following express server code that uses Resonate:

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-1-gateway-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-1/src/gateway.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-1/src/gateway.ts)
```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import { Resonate, Context } from "@resonatehq/sdk";
import { downloadAndSummarize } from "./app";

// Initialize a Resonate application.
const resonate = new Resonate();

// Register a function as a Resonate function
resonate.register(
  "downloadAndSummarize", // function name
  downloadAndSummarize, // function pointer
  resonate.options({ timeout: 20000 }) // set a total execution timeout of 20 seconds
);

// Start the Resonate application
resonate.start();

// Initialize an Express application.
const app = express().use(express.json());

// Register a function as an Express endpoint
app.post("/summarize", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const url = req.body?.url;
  try {
    // Call the resonate function
    let summary = await resonate.run(
      "downloadAndSummarize", // function name
      `summarize-${url}`, // promise ID
      url // function argument
    );
    res.send(summary);
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred.");
  }
});

// Start the Express application
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 3000");
});
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

The `gateway.ts` file contains an Express server that listens on port 3000 and includes a single route handler that leverages Resonate to run the `downloadAndSummarize()` function.
To set it up, you instantiate a Resonate object, register the top-level function via `resonate.run()`, call `resonate.start()`, and create an Express HTTP handler for the `/summarize` route before starting the server on port 3000.

When calling `resonate.run()`, you must provide the function name, a unique identifier, and the function’s arguments.
The identifier serves as the promise ID for the function execution.
If you use the same identifier for multiple calls to `resonate.run()`, you will receive the result from the initial execution without re-running the function.
To get a new result on each call, you need to supply a different promise ID.

Lastly, make sure to update your `package.json` file to include the following scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx tsx src/gateway.ts"
  }
}
```

## Run the application

To start your summarization service run `npm start`.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Then, from another terminal send a `POST` request to the `/summarize` endpoint.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://example.com"}'
```

Watch the log output of your service.
There is a good chance that you will see either "download failed" or "summarization failed" or both one or more times.

However, even if you see those failures logged, eventually you should get the text response, "This is a summary of the text", back to where you made POST request.

After the request for example.com succeeds, try running it again.
Notice how on subsequent requests with the same URL, Resonate does not start the executions again but returns the same root-level promise immediately.

This is because the url makes up part of the root-level promise ID.
The Resonate TypeScript SDK stores that promise locally and ensures that if the same ID is used in subsequent calls, the result of the execution associated with that promise is returned.

However, if you restart the service or provide a different url, the service will execute the functions again.

In the next part of the tutorial, you will connect to a Resonate Server which stores the promise remotely, so that even if your HTTP server crashes, the function executions will be able to eventually complete.

## Install the Resonate Server

Now it is time to connect your service to a Resonate Server to enable recovery from platform-level failures.
To simulate a platform-level failure, you will kill the HTTP server process in the middle of the execution of the `downloadAndSummarize()` function.

Follow the steps in the [Resonate Server install guide](/get-started/server-installation) to install and run the server on your machine.

By default, the Server runs on localhost port 8001.

After the server is running, you can update your service code.

## Update your code

There are three places where you need to update your code for this nex part of the tutorial.

First, in your `gateway.ts` file, update the `new Resonate()` call and provide it with the URL of the server, in this case `http://localhost:8001`.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-server-url-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/gateway.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/gateway.ts)
```ts
// Initialize a Resonate application.
const resonate = new Resonate({ url: "http://localhost:8001" });
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

Then, extend the top-level promise resolution timeout to a full minute.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-register-timeout-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/gateway.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/gateway.ts)
```ts
// Register a function as a Resonate function
resonate.register(
  "downloadAndSummarize", // function name
  downloadAndSummarize, // function pointer
  resonate.options({ timeout: 60000 }) // set a total execution timeout of 1 minute
);
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

You are increasing the top-level promise resolution timeout to a full minute so that you have time to kill the service and bring it back up again.

And finally, in your `app.ts` file add a 10 second sleep to the `downloadAndSummarize()` function between `download()` and `summarize()`.

<!--SNIPSTART quickstart-ts-part-2-add-sleep-->
[docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/app.ts](https://github.com/resonatehq/docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/typescript-quickstart/code/part-2/src/app.ts)
```ts
export async function downloadAndSummarize(ctx: Context, url: string) {
  console.log("Downloading and summarizing content from", url);

  // Download the content from the provided URL
  let content = await ctx.run(download, url);

  // Sleep for 10 seconds
  await ctx.sleep(10000);

  // Summarize the downloaded content
  let summary = await ctx.run(summarize, content);

  // Return the summary of the content
  return summary;
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

You are adding a 10 second sleep so that you have time between the `download()` step and the `summarize()` step so that you have time to kill the service before the `summarize()` step starts.

Now that you have your code updated, it is time to simulate a service outage.

## Simulate a crash

If you haven't already, restart your HTTP service with the updated code.

```shell
npm start
```

After your service is running with the updated code, send the `POST` request to your service.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://example.com"}'
```

Let it run it until you see that the log "download successful", then kill (Ctrl-c) the service.

:::note

Because you are using cURL from another terminal, you will get "received".
In Part 1 of the tutorial, killing the HTTP service would have resulted in the loss of the state of the executions.
However, because the service is connected to the Resonate Server, when you bring the service back up, the execution sequence continues from where it left off.

:::

Start the service again.
Assuming that you stopped the service after the `download()` function ran, you should now see the `summarize()` function logs and the application complete its execution.

Lets, look at the sequence diagram to understand what happened.

![Remote promise storage diagram with retries](/img/remote-storage-promise-with-retries.svg)

In the diagram above, you can map function 1 to `downloadAndSummarize()`, function 2 to `download()`, and function 3 to `summarize()`.
Notice how function 1 gets the result of function 2 from the Durable Promise after the process restarts.
That is because the result of function 2 was stored in promise 2 before the process crashed.
This effectively resumes the execution of function 1 from where it left off.

Next, you will inspect the promise in the Resonate Server to see that it resolved successfully.

## Inspect promises

You can inspect the promises stored in the Resonate Server via the Resonate CLI.

```bash
resonate promise get summarize-http://example.com
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Id:       summarize-http://example.com
State:    RESOLVED
Timeout:  9008909898871320

Idempotency Key (create):    summarize-http://example.com
Idempotency Key (complete):  summarize-http://example.com

Param:
  Headers:
  Data:
    {"func":"downloadAndSummarize","args":["http://example.com"]}

Value:
  Headers:
  Data:
    "This is a summary of the text"

Tags:
  resonate:invocation:  true
```

:::tip

Try out your app again with another url (to create a new promise with a different ID).
Then, kill the HTTP service halfway through execution.
Query for the promise in the Resonate Server and check out the status.

You should see that the promise is marked `PENDING`.

Bring your HTTP service back up and and then query for the promise again.

It should be marked `RESOLVED`.

:::

So, now you should have a good understanding of how to use the Resonate SDK and the Resonate Server to build a distributed async await applications!
