This quickstart tutorial introduces you to the Resonate HQ TypeScript SDK.

## Part 1

In [Part 1](/get-started/typescript-quickstart/part-1), you develop your first _Distributed Async Await_ application with the Resonate HQ SDK, a summarization service.
This part illustrates features such as transparent function retries and retry rate limits, simply through the integration of the Resonate HQ SDK, without the need for any additional infrastructure.

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
