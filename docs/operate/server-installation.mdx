Install and run the Resonate Server to provide durability to your application through hard crashes and failures.

## MacOS and Linux

**How to run the Resonate Server on your Mac OS or Linux machine?**

You can use Brew, or if you have Golang installed, you can build it from source.

To install it with Brew and run it as a single binary, run the following commands:

```shell
brew install resonatehq/tap/resonate
resonate serve
```

The above command installs and starts the Resonate Server using a default configuration.

## Build from source

Alternatively, you can build and run it from source.
Make sure you have the Go programming language installed.
Then, run the following commands to download the repository and build the server:

```
git clone https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate
cd resonate
go build -o resonate
```

After it is built, you can compile and run it as a Go program using the following command:

```
go run main.go serve
```

Or, you can run it as an executable using the following command:

```
./resonate server
```

Once running, you'll see log output like:

```bash
time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting http server" addr=0.0.0.0:8001
time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting grpc server" addr=0.0.0.0:50051
time=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00 level=INFO msg="starting metrics server" addr=:9090
```

## Release artifacts

You may also download the GitHub artifacts directly from the [repo](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/releases).

## Configuration

Optionally, you can start Resonate with a configuration file.

```bash
./resonate serve --config resonate.yml
```

The following example file lists all default settings.
