## Error Schema

When an error occurs, the response body will contain the following information.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 5002,
    "message": "failed to update promise",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "ServerError",
        "message": "attempt to write a readonly database",
        "domain": "server",
        "metadata": {
          "url": "https://docs.resonatehq.io/reference/error-codes#5002"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `code` field can be used to programmatically identify the error. The message and details provide a human readable description of what went wrong.

The `details` provide structured diagnostic data such as the originating subsystem and links to documentation which can assist in debugging and troubleshooting.
