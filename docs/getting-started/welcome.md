# Why Resonate?

- Resonate offers a programming model that enables you to build distributed applications using an intuitive paradigm you already know â€” **async await**.

- Resonate embraces the spirit of **open source** and **open collaboration**.

- Resonate's **distributed async await** builds on [durable promises](/reference/durable-promises.md), an open standard with a minimal and accessible API.

# Distributed async await

Resonate introduces distributed async await, a powerful feature that allows functions and promises to maintain progress in durable storage. With this approach, function executions have an unique identity that persists beyond the execution of the underlying function. This simple yet effective concept enables developers to coordinate processes, implement transaction semantics, and handle failures gracefully across distributed systems.
