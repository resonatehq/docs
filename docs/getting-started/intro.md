# Why Resonate?

Resonate offers a cloud computing model that allows you to build resilient applications using an intuitive programming interface you already know — **async • await**.

## Dead Simple Coordination

With a familiar interface, you can create and coordinate distributed services without learning complex failure handling techniques or vendor-specific concepts. On day one, use your existing async • await programming knowledge to build systems that recover transparently from failures.

## Various Degrees of Reliability

The Resonate library offers two reliability modes to meet your needs:

- `Resilient` mode provides medium failsafe protection with progress stored in-memory, for less critical applications or testing. **No infrastructure required.**
- `Durable` mode offers the highest reliability with complete fault-tolerance across application restarts, using the Resonate engine.

You can toggle between these two modes depending on your reliability requirements.
