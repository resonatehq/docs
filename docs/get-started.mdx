How to get started using Resonate?

The answer can be a little bit use case specific, however generically you would follow these steps.

### Choose your SDK

Resonate HQ currently has a TypeScript SDK and a Python SDK.

However, the SDKs are currently at different stages of development and do not yet offer the same set of capabilities and features.

You may consider which SDK to use based on your use case.

### Install the SDK

Next, install the SDK with your language's dependency manager.

For TypeScript this would be `npm` or `yarn`.
For Python this could be `pip`, `pipenv`, or `poetry` for example.

### Start building your application

Generically speaking, to use a Resonate HQ SDK in your application you will do the following:

1. Import the SDK package into your project.
2. Register the functions that you want to have Durable Promises.
3. Start and run functions using the handle provided by the SDK.

Just by using the SDK, your application will have access to automatic and configurable failure detection and mitigation through timeouts and retries as well as a few other features.

### Connect to a Resonate HQ Server

To make your promises and functions durable even in the face of complete hardware crashes, then start a Resonate Server and provide the connection URL to the handle provided by the SDK.
