A programming model built on an **open specification, such as [Distributed Async Await](/concepts/distributed-async-await)**, enhances the developer experience by fostering transparency, interoperability, and flexibility.
Developers benefit from a clear understanding of how the system operates, thanks to detailed documentation and community-driven insights.
This transparency builds trust, while the adherence to open standards ensures high-quality and maintainable code.
The interoperability enabled by open specifications allows developers to use their preferred tools and deploy applications across diverse environments without worrying about vendor lock-in, giving them freedom and control over their workflows.

Open specifications also encourage innovation and community collaboration.
All of Resonate's components are open source, and built on top of an open specification which enables contributions that enrich the ecosystem with tools, libraries, and resources while empowering developers to extend or customize solutions to meet specific needs.
With access to a shared knowledge base and compatibility across platforms, developers can focus on building features rather than battling constraints.
By offering portability, extensibility, and long-term stability, open specification-based programming models provide an exceptional foundation for creating scalable, reliable, and developer-friendly applications.
