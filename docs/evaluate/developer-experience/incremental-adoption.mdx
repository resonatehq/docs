**Incremental adoption** refers to the ability to integrate Resonate into an existing application gradually, avoiding the common “all-or-nothing” challenge of adopting new technology.
With Resonate, you can start small, experimenting with its programming model in a single-node setup before scaling to more complex, distributed workflows.

Resonate’s flexibility supports various persistence strategies, including storing promises in local memory.
This means you can adopt the programming model and benefit from features like **automatic function execution retries** with minimal overhead.
While the local memory store doesn’t provide process crash recovery, it offers an easy and lightweight way to get started without requiring a full infrastructure setup.

This incremental approach removes the pressure of big migrations or costly refactorings.
It enables you to explore the power of **Distributed Async Await** by installing the Resonate SDK—just like any other package in your language environment—without needing a supervisor or persistence server initially.

Resonate’s **Local Mode** is perfect for trying out **Distributed Async Await** in single-node applications.

In Local Mode:

- You can integrate Resonate’s programming model with no external dependencies.
- There’s no need to run the Resonate Server, keeping your setup lightweight and straightforward.
- It’s ideal for experimenting with the framework or building parts of your application incrementally.

Once you’re ready to scale, you can transition to **Remote Mode**, unlocking the full power of Resonate for distributed recovery and resume.

With Resonate, you can adopt Distributed Async Await incrementally by starting with Local Mode and then moving to Remote Mode.

Local Mode is ideal for starting out with Resonate.
It enables you to integrate Distributed Async Await into a single Application Node without the overhead of running the Resonate Server.

Try Part 1 of the quickstart tutorials to see Local Mode in action:

For practical guidance on switching between Local and Remote mode, see the following feature guidance:
