**Fan-out/Fan-in** is an architectural pattern designed to distribute computation across multiple resources, automatically scaling as application load increases.

This approach helps eliminate bottlenecks and ensures application flows can continue to progress efficiently, even under high demand.

With **Resonate**, you can scale dynamically by running as many **Application Nodes** as needed, all deployed with the same code base.
When a flow requires additional capacity, any available Application Node can pick up the next task, enabling seamless distribution of workloads without developer intervention.

Resonate also provides developers with fine-grained control over how and where to apply fan-out/fan-in within their application flows.
Unlike an all-or-nothing approach, Resonateâ€™s APIs allow you to decide which parts of your flow benefit from this pattern, ensuring optimal scaling and resource utilization.
