Application architecture refers to the high-level structure and design of an application, including how its components interact, how data flows, and how it meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

Resonate serves a wide range of application architectures, from simple to complex, and from synchronous to asynchronous.
Here are some common application architectures that Resonate can help you build.

import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
