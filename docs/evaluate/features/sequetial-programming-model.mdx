When you use Resonate to build applications, you benefit from a sequential, holistic, programming model that simplifies the development of complex, distributed applications.
The programming model is based on functions and promises, which are familiar concepts to most developers, we call it [Distributed Async Await](/concepts/distributed-async-await).

Consider the following pseudo-code example:

```
fn () {
    await step1();
    await step2();
    await step3();
    await step4();
}
```

The pseudo-code example above is probably familiar to you if you have developed single node applications that run in a single process.
The code is easy to read and understand, and it is easy to reason about.

When you use Resonate to build applications, you can write code like the example above, and Resonate will ensure the steps execute, even if the steps execute on different [Application Nodes](/concepts/application-node).

Get started using one of the following quickstart tutorials:

- [Python SDK quickstart Part 1](/get-started/python-quickstart)
- [TypeScript SDK quickstart Part 1](/get-started/typescript-quickstart)

Or jump right into the feature development guides:

- [TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript)
- [Python SDK](/develop/python)

The main difference between normal promises and Resonate's promises, is that [Resonate's promises are durable](/concepts/durable-promise).

With Resonate, you don't have to worry about learning to use special primitives like Workflows or Activities, just functions and promises.
