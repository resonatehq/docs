When you use Resonate to build applications, each [Application Node](/concepts/application-node) in the [Call Graph](/concepts/call-graph) benefits from the ability to recover after a process crash.

If the process crashes, the Call Graph can resume on a completely different Application Node, or on the same Application Node once the process restarts.

For examples of how to connect to a Resonate Server from an Application Node, to enable Call Graph recovery see the following feature guidance:

- [TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript#remote-storage)
- [Python SDK](/develop/python#remote-storage)

For a deep dive into the different storage modes, see [Durable Promises](/concepts/durable-promise).
For a deep dive into the Call Graph, see [Call Graph](/concepts/call-graph).
