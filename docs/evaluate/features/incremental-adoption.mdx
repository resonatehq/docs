With Resonate, you can adopt Distributed Async Await incrementally by starting with Local Mode and then moving to Remote Mode.

Local Mode is ideal for starting out with Resonate.
It enables you to integrate Distributed Async Await into a single Application Node without the overhead of running the Resonate Server.

Try Part 1 of the quickstart tutorials to see Local Mode in action:

- [Python-SDK quickstart - Part 1 Incremental adoption](/get-started/python-quickstart#part-1-incremental-adoption)
- [TypeScript SDK quickstart - Part 1 Incremental adoption](/get-started/typescript-quickstart#part-1-incremental-adoption)

For practical guidance on switching between Local and Remote mode, see the following feature guidance:

- [TypeScript storage modes](/develop/typescript#promise-storage-modes)

For a deep dive into the different storage modes, see [Durable Promises](/concepts/durable-promise).
