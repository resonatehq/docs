When you use Resonate to build applications, every function in the application's call graph benefits from automatic retries should the execution fail or return an error or exception.

You can configure a Retry Policy at the Application Node level or per function.

Check out examples for the following SDKs:

- [Set a customer Retry Policy in Python](/develop/python#set-a-retry-policy)
- [Set a custom Retry Policy in TypeScript](/develop/typescript#set-a-retry-policy)

See [Resonate Retry Policies](/concepts/failure-detection-and-recovery#retry-policies) for a deep dive into the built-in Retry Policies and their behavior.
