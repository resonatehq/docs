## Resonate vs job queue

**What is the benefit of using Resonate over a job queue?**

Persisting a job to a queue implies that there is no single place where the business flow of the application is defined.
Essentially, the distributed application relies on a service or component each to play a part and then hand off the next step to another service or component.
Practically this makes it very hard to for a single developer to learn, reason about, and contribute to the application's business flow.

On a high level: Resonate is a sequentially looking programming model on top of an concurrent execution model (a job queue).

One can argue that a Resonate Function consisting of one span/step and a job on a job queue are an equivalent experience in functionality.
The difference comes down to the developer experience and the ability to reason about the application's business flow.
