Resonate facilitates the development and operation of distributed applications.
The following diagram illustrates the system architecture of Resonate:

![Resonate system architecture](/img/resonate-architecture.svg)

Developers use the Resonate SDK to build applications.
Each process where the Resonate SDK is used to call `resonate.run()` is called an [Application Node](/concepts/application-node).
A Resonate application can have between 1 and n Application Nodes.
The Application Nodes are responsible for executing functions.

Each Application Node connects to a Resonate Server.
the Resonate Server acts as supervisor, monitoring the status on function executions of Application Nodes.
The Resonate Server also manages the storage of Durable Promises, which can be awaited on by functions across Application Nodes, effectively providing Distributed Async Await.
