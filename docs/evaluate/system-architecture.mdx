Resonate facilitates the development and operation of distributed applications.
The following diagram illustrates the system architecture of Resonate:

### Resonate SDK

Developers use the Resonate SDK to build applications.
It enables developers to write sequential programs using just functions and promises that execute asynchronously across multiple processes or machines.

Each process where the Resonate SDK is used to call `resonate.run()` is known as an [Application Node](/concepts/application-node).
A Resonate application can have between 1 and n Application Nodes.
The Application Nodes are responsible for executing functions.

Resonate offers SDKs for the following langauges:

- [Python](/develop/python)
- [TypeScript](/develop/typescript)

### Resonate Server

Each Application Node connects to a Resonate Server.
The Resonate Server is a superivisor service that manages the storage of [Durable Promises](/concepts/durable-promise) and routes Remote Function Calls (RFIs).

[Install the Resonate Server](/get-started/server-quickstart) and connect your Application Nodes to make promises durable.

### Resonate CLI

The Resonate CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with the Resonate Server.

It comes with the Resonate Server.

Review the [Resonate CLI reference](/operate/cli-reference) for more information.
