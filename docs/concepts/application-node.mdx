A Resonate HQ Application Node can be described as a deployed bundle of code that has a top-level function registered with and run by `resonate.run()`.

![Application Node Call Graph Local Process](/img/application-node-call-graph-local-process.svg)

The call to `resonate.run()` creates a top-level promise in the call graph.

To handle throughput and availability, you can have many Application Nodes, each running the same bundle of code.

If we take the [TypeScript SDK quickstart tutorial](/get-started/typescript-quickstart/) as an example, the "bundle of code" is the three functions `downloadAndSummarize()`, `download()` and `summarize()`.

```typescript
import { Context } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

// downloadAndSummarize is the top level function that awaits on the download and summarize functions.
export async function downloadAndSummarize(ctx: Context, url: string) {
  // Download the content from the provided URL
  let content = await ctx.run(download, url);
  // Summarize the downloaded content
  let summary = await ctx.run(summarize, content);
  // Return the summary of the content
  return summary;
}

async function download(ctx: Context, url: string): Promise<string> {
  // ...
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("download complete");
  });
}

async function summarize(ctx: Context, text: string): Promise<string> {
  // ...
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("summary of text");
  });
}
```

This code could be deployed to many hosts, each considered an Application Node.
