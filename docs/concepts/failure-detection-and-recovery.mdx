**Timeouts and Idempotency**

Durable promises are attempted to be resolved and retried up until the specified timeout. It's crucial to ensure that the operations performed by your durable functions are [idempotent](https://blog.bitsrc.io/design-an-idempotent-api-in-2024-d4a3cf8d8bf2) to prevent undefined behavior.

```ts
const resonate = new Resonate({
  // Configures the default durable promise
  // timeout in ms, used for every function
  // executed by calling resonate.run.
  // Defaults to 1000.
  timeout: 5000,
});
```
