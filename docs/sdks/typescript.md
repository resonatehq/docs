# Typescript

Welcome to Resonate's guide to the Resonate Typescript SDK! This SDK makes it easy to write distributed async/await applications with elegance and simplicity. Let's dive in and explore how you can leverage this powerful tool.

## Installation

To get started, simply install the SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install @resonatehq/sdk
```

## Getting Started

It all starts with a top-level object creation:

```ts
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

const resonate = new Resonate();
```

## Registering Functions

To fully leverage the potential of Resonate, you must first register your function. Once registered, you can invoke it using `resonate.run`, passing the registered function's ID, a UID for the execution, and the function's arguments. `resonate.run` will execute your code until completion, even in the presence of hardware or software failure.

```ts
import { Resonate, Context } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

resonate.register("purchase", purchase);

resonate.run("purchase", id, user, song);
```

## Resonate Context

All interactions with the runtime occur through the Resonate context, which provides methods like `ctx.run()`. These methods offer transparent retries, recoverability, task distribution, and more. Therefore, all top-level functions and intermediary steps must accept a Resonate context as their first argument.

```ts
async function purchase(ctx: Context, user: User, song: Song): Promise<Status> {
  const charged = await ctx.run(charge, user, song);
  const granted = await ctx.run(access, user, song);
  return { charged, granted };
}

async function charge(ctx: Context, user: User, song: Song): Promise<boolean> {
  console.log(`Charged user:${user.id} $${song.price}.`);
  return true;
}

async function access(ctx: Context, user: User, song: Song): Promise<boolean> {
  console.log(`Granted user:${user.id} access to song:${song.id}.`);
  return true;
}
```

## Configurations

Resonate provides a range of configuration options to customize its behavior. If options are not provided, sensible defaults are used.

### Global Configuration

You can configure the SDK globally via the top-level Resonate object:

```ts
const resonate = new Resonate({
  // The remote promise store URL. If not provided, an in-memory promise store will be used.
  url: "https://my-remote-store.com",
  // A logger instance. If not provided, a default logger will be used.
  logger: myLogger,
  // A retry instance. Defaults to exponential backoff.
  retry: myRetry,
  // The default promise timeout in ms, used for every function executed by calling run. Defaults to 1000.
  timeout: 5000,
  // Tags to add to all durable promises.
  tags: Record<string, string>,
});
```

### Function-specific Configuration

When registering functions with `resonate.register()`, you can provide function-specific options:

```ts
resonate.register(
  "downloadAndSummarize",
  downloadAndSummarize,
  resonate.options({
    // Overrides the default timeout.
    timeout: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
    // Overrides the default retry policy.
    retry: IRetry,
    // Additional tags to add to the durable promise.
    tags: Record<string, string>,
  })
);
```
